    "__Author__: Pat McCornack\n",
    "\n",
    "__Date__: 3/25/24\n",
    "\n",
    "__Purpose__: Use LANDFIRE data to create sample points to train F40 classification model on. Currently set up to use LF23 data. Outputs a layer of 100,000 points with data extracted from the following rasters: FBFM40, FVT, FVC, FVH, FDST, LF ZONE, and BPS_FRG_NEW. Shapefile is output to sample_points directory with the datetime at which it was generated in the file name. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Environment Set Up__: To set up the environment to use arcpy copy the arcgispro-py3 environment to your conda environments folder. For me these were located at:\n",
    "1. C:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\envs\n",
    "2. C:\\Users\\\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\miniconda3\\envs\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply copy the arcgispro-py3 folder from <1> to <2>.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: The final product should filter points out that are within two cells of another point (i.e. ~60m). This is currently not working in the script and needs to be fixed. \n",
