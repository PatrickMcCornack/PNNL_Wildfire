# PNNL_Wildfire
Scripts from my work as a research associate working on a wildfire project at the Pacific Northwest National Lab.

__LF22-23_F40_GROUP_eda__ - Script to explore whether and to what degree there were transitions between FBFM40 "parent classes". The purpose of this is to determine whether LANDFIRE was treating these classes as structural and static in order to decide whether it makes sense to include F40_GROUP as a predictor.
