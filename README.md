# PNNL_Wildfire
Scripts from my work as a research associate working on a wildfire project at the Pacific Northwest National Lab.

__FBFM_fuels_modeling.ipynb__ - This is the primary part of this project where I am working on building a machine learning model that uses updated LANDFIRE data to created a fuelscape classified using 40 Scott and Burgan fuel models. The goal is to use this model to replace the current labor intensive and inaccurate method of doing this. 

__F40_distribution_eda.ipynb__ - Script to evaluate F40 distributions in a variety of contexts to inform model development. 

__LF22-23_F40_GROUP_eda__ - Script to explore whether and to what degree there were transitions between FBFM40 "parent classes". The purpose of this is to determine whether LANDFIRE was treating these classes as structural and static in order to decide whether it makes sense to include F40_GROUP as a predictor.
